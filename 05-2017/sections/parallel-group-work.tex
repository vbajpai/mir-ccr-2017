\subsection{P4 and SDN}

P4~\cite{pbosshart:ccr:2014} is a language that allows to program the
structural layout of protocol headers, as well as, processing operations
performed on those.  This allows to perform matching on arbitrary fields of
even completely new protocols, in contrast to for instance OpenFlow with few
predefined fields.  The breakout session aims to first define the
functionality and potential use cases of P4.  Then, potential
extensions~\cite{abhashkumar:sosr:2017} for functionality that might be
desired, but are not yet supported or even intended by P4 will covered.
