\subsection{Precise User Tracking Based on TLS Client Certificate Authentication} %(TMA'17) -- can scale to 15 to 25 min —

The design and implementation of cryptographic systems offer many subtle
pitfalls. One such pitfall is that cryptography may create unique identifiers
potentially usable to repeatedly and precisely re-identify and hence track
users. Quirin Scheitle (TU Munich) presented his investigation of TLS Client
Certificate Authentication (CCA), which currently transmits certificates in
plain text. He demonstrated~\cite{qscheitle:tma:2017} CCA’s impact on client
traceability using Apple’s Apple Push Notification service (APNs) as an
example. APNs is used by all Apple products, employs plain-text CCA, and aims
to be constantly connected to its backend. Its novel combination of large
device count, constant connections, device proximity to users and unique
client certificates provides for precise client traceability. He shows that
passive eavesdropping allows to precisely re-identify and track users and that
only ten interception points are required to track more than 80 percent of
APNs users due to global routing characteristics. The work was conducted under
strong ethical guidelines, with responsibly disclosing the findings, and a
working patch by Apple for the highlighted issue was confirmed. The aim for
this work is to provide the necessary factual and quantified evidence about
negative implications of plain-text CCA to boost deployment of encrypted CCA
as in TLS 1.3.
