  -- social levels aspects of the technology
  -- systems community people
  -- avoid curated IoT ecosystem (such as iOS store)

-- less time for talks x 2, more time for breakout session x 4

-- confine breadth? -- No, hard to know upfront who is coming. It's about
   people with expertise that come

-- well done! -- controversial statements to start the discussion of a break
   out session.

-- have a talk identify high-level problems.

-- poster session, breakouts, coffee breaks were good.

   possibility to share the posters upfront.

-- smaller tables for dinner, name tags at dinner tables.

-- have the posters in the same room, more time during the posters.

-- industry and academia -- 50%

-- more industry talks.
