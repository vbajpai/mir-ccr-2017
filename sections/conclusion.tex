The 1\textsuperscript{st} Munich Internet Research retreat concluded
successfully on November 24--25, 2016. All the presentation material and
contact information of presenters are available online~\cite{mir-materials}. A
second iteration of the retreat is planned for May 23--24, 2017 with a webpage
currently available online \cite{mir2017}. The readers are encouraged to
contact the organizers to learn more about the the next retreat.

We also collected some feedback from the participants. Academic participants
expressed that this retreat was a good chance to talk to fellow researchers,
although the topics were quite diverse.  While the 1\textsuperscript{st}
retreat was open in terms of topics (as will be the upcoming
2\textsuperscript{nd} retreat), we are considering running workshops focused
on topic areas as an option for the future.  Industrial participants found the
breakout sessions useful since it helped them to get an overview of current
academic research. It was mentioned that such an interaction also helps bring
some of the academic research back to the industry. Longer breakout sessions
(by reducing the number of invited presentations) and dedicated sessions for
doctoral candidates were advised. The idea of inviting more industry
participants was also suggested.
