The 1\textsuperscript{st} Munich Internet Research retreat concluded
successfully on Nov 24\textsuperscript{th}-25\textsuperscript{th}, 2016. All
of the presentation material and contact information of presenters are
available online \cite{mir-materials}. A second iteration of the retreat is
planned for 2017.  The readers are encouraged to contact the authors of this
report to learn more about the organization of the next retreat.

We collected some feedback from the participants. Academic participants
expressed that this retreat was a good chance to talk to fellow researchers,
although the topics were quite diverse. We plan to add more focus to the
topics in subsequent retreats. Industrial participants found the breakout
sessions useful since it helped them to get an overview of current academic
research. It was mentioned that such an interaction also helps bring some of
the academic research back to the industry. Longer breakout sessions (by
reducing the number of invited presentations) and dedicated sessions for
doctoral candidates were advised. The idea of inviting more industry
participants was also suggested.
