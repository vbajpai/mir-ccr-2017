The 1\textsuperscript{st} \ac{MIR} retreat was organized November 24--25, 2016 at
the TU Munich (TUM) Science and Study Center in Raitenhaslach, Germany.  The retreat
invited academic and industrial researchers working on networking research in
the Munich area to not only exchange ideas but also develop collaborations
for future research.  It was organized in a spirit that is similar to an
highly interactive ``Dagstuhl'' seminars, with a very limited number of
full-length talks, while dedicating most of the time to poster sessions and
group discussions.

Presentations on topics such as: \ac{SDN}, \ac{NFV}, \ac{ICN}, \ac{IoT},
Internet measurements and security-related research were solicited. The
invited presentations were intended to trigger discussions and identify areas
for group work. The retreat consisted of ten invited presentations and eleven
posters presenting early and upcoming research, with six breakout sessions to
discuss topics of interests in an informal setting. Synopses of these three
sessions are described in more detail.
