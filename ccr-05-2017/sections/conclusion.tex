The overall feedback of our participants has shown, that the 2\textsuperscript{nd} Munich Internet Research Retreat that took place at May 23--24, 2017 was quite successful. However, the organizers of the upcoming \ac{MIRR} will incorporate as much of the feedback of participants as possible to further improve the event. Talks shall be no longer than ten minutes and have the character of lightning talks, i.e. talks about work in progress and open questions instead of polished, already published results. Furthermore, we will prepare agenda and topics of the upcoming \ac{MIRR} in a more interactive manner before the retreat and include our participants. This step will ensure that all participants will find a suitable breakout session and come preloaded with knowledge.

Most of the presentation material of outlined talks, summaries of breakout sessions, and contact information of presenters are available online~\cite{mir-materials}.

A follow-up retreat will take place in November 2017. Interested readers are encouraged to contact the organizers to learn the exact day, about topics and about the organization. Furthermore we would like to share experiences with organizers of similar events.
