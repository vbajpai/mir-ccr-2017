This article describes the format of an outset series of research retreats and
our efforts to improve the outcomes and the participation experience. We believe
that our lessons learned are beneficial for organizers of similar events.
The Munich Internet Research Retreat (MIRR) is a two-day gathering of Internet
researchers from academia and industry locating in Munich, Germany area.
The goal is to provide a forum for researchers to exchange ideas, get feedback
on their current work, enlarge their professional network,  and to foster collaboration
between industry and academia. MIRR is organized in a highly interactive style.
It consists of six short talks and most of the time is dedicated to poster sessions,
group discussions, and breakout sessions. A further important element is the
feedback session at the end of the retreat where we collect suggestions for improvement.
After the inaugural event in November 2016, MIRR took place for the second time in May 2017. 
Further successors are planned every six months. Presentations delivered during
the seminar are made publicly available online \cite{mir-materials}.
