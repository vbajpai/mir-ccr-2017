This article describes the format of a rather young series of research retreats and our efforts to improve their outcomes and the experience of our participants as we believe that our lessons learned are beneficial for organizers of similar retreats.
The MIRR (Munich Internet Research Retreat) is a two-day gathering of Internet researchers from academia and industry from the Munich, Germany area.
The goal of the retreats is to provide a forum for researchers to exchange ideas, get feedback on their current work, enlarge their professional network,  and to foster collaboration between industry and academia.
MIRR is organized in a highly interactive style. We limit ourselves to about six short talks and dedicate most of the time to poster sessions, group discussions, and breakout sessions. A further important element is a feedback session at the end of the retreat where we collect suggestions for improvements to further optimize MIRR.
After the inaugural event in November 2016, MIRR took place for the second time in May 2017. Further successors are planned every six months.
Presentations delivered during the seminar are made publicly available online \cite{mir-materials}.
