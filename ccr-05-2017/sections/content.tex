2. IoT, ICN and Edge Computing [Aaron]

One domain covered in MIRR is the intersection of IoT, Information-Centric
Networking (ICN) and Edge Computing. There were three invited talks that triggered
lively discussions. The invited talks include 
``Edge Computing considered harmful" by Dirk Kutscher (Huawei), 
``Open Platforms for Cyber-physical systems" by Christian Prehofer (fortiss),
and ``Opportunistic Content Dissemination in Dense Network Segments"
by Teemu Kärkkäinen (TU Munich). Inspired by those talks, discussion groups
have been formed to review the existing issues, open problems, and 
research directions. The identified problems include: 1) Limitation
of existing protocols such as Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) that
handles poorly the frequent leaving/joining events in the network. 2) The
stereotype of ``IoT gateway design'' has hindered novel design. 3) We still
have not yet come up with a suitable Internet architecture that integrates
IoT coherently. There are six open questions highlighted: 1) Where does the network
end nowadays? This question couples
with the ICN where nodes can contribute to the computation/content along
the path. 2) What functions on gateway functions we can remove? 3) How to do
naming ``translation'' without changing name/label? 4) Can we do packet
processing while it is passing through queue? 5) How to avoid looping in
the network functions? This is a key concern since we need to keep a
boundary for resource usage in the network. 6) How to maintain the state on
the constrained nodes? The discussion groups also identified a set of potential
research directions: 1) Design of end-to-end naming scheme, to facilitate IoT
application composition and bring down the overhead of porting applications
for the cloud to ``gateways''. 2) Semantics for individual sensor and
equivalence group. 3) Trade accuracy with replication. 4) A new computation
abstract suitable for IoT. 5) Abstract of distributed registry for network
function. 6) Rethink how we distribute computing and content.
Besides invited talks, MIRR also featured several posters on this topic, including
``iConfig - What I See is What I Configure", 
``Fine-Grained Edge Offloading for IoT"~\cite{cozzolino:hotconnet:2017},
``Opportunistic Content Dissemination",
``Data Dissemination in Vehicular Networks",
``Lightweight Virtualization for Smart Cars"~\cite{rmorabito:im:2017},
``Car2X Lab", and ``Securebox"~\cite{hafeez:can:2016}.
